> No classes today! Because it's **holiday**!

A minimalist classless CSS theme with dark mode support. Only 5 KB.

## [Demo](https://holidaycss.js.org/)

## Why

I got tired of complex markup and tons of classes on every element.

See form example: [Bootstrap](https://jsfiddle.net/z16aknfh/3/) vs
[holiday.css](https://jsfiddle.net/5egfxtLc/1/).

## Features

- makes your page fit even the smallest screens, no more broken `<body>` width
  due to wide tables
- supports all
  [`<input>` types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#%3Cinput%3E_types)
- highlights invalid fields in your forms (that's right, no JS needed for that!)
- makes your `<nav>` look nice, turns your nested `<ul>` lists into **accessible
  dropdowns** (making <kbd>Tab</kbd> work with dropdowns in plain CSS was really
  tricky!)
- doesn't waste precious horizontal space on mobile screens for `<picture>`,
  `video`, `<table>`, and `<pre>` by ignoring body margins and filling 100% of
  screen width
- keeps selector specificity as low as possible, so you could easily extend it
  with CSS classes without using `!important`
- supports **dark mode** out of the box
- built with **pure CSS**
- only **~5 KB** (minified and gzipped)
